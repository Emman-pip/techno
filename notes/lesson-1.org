* Mindsetting
** Silicon Valley

** Startup
    - A company in the initial business stage
    - focused on solving a specific problem of a specific market using innovative approaches
    - can be funded by angel investors, venture capitalists, crowdfunding, credit, or even family and friends
    - chances that a startup may fail in its first year is very high -- usually caused by lack of a user-centric solution

** Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
    - a development technich in which a new product is introduced in the market with basic features, but enough to get attention
    - final product is released after getting sufficient feedback from the initial users

** Four Founders Mindset

*** Carlo Valencia
    - founder and facilitator at startup PH training

*** Four Founders Mindset
    1. find users
       - identify who their customers or users are, what their needs or problems are and how they can be engaged
    2. founders don't have plans to execure, they have assumptions to test
       - it will always be a constant search for the right plan to execute
    3. everything is an experiment
       - eric ries
       - build-measure-learn
    4. you will fail
       - there is no undefeated innovation and entrepreneurship
***** eric ries
	- an american entrpreneur
	- coined 5 principles of lean startup
	- build-measure-learn feedback loop
	- build with minimal effort -  measure feedback (validation of targets) - learn (either improve or REDO an MVP)
** Fixed mindset vs Growth mindset
*** Caroll Dweck

*** Five phases of design thinking framework
    1. empathy

    2. define
       - create a customer persona where they will define the following: goals and aspirations, motivations, frustrations, and personal beliefs
    3. ideate
       - brainstorm and generate as many ideas as possible
    4. prototype
       - build or prototype using inexpensive materials
    5. test
       - show the developed prototypes to customers
       - get feedbacks
       - this phase will determine whether to pursue theidea or pivot to a new idea
