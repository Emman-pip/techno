* problem-solving hypothesis 
** hypothesis
    - a statement that seeks to explain why something has happened or might happen, under certain conditions
    - often written as if-then statements
    - uses sample data to extrapolate insights about a larger population
** hypothesis driven entrepreneurship in startups
    - since startups often confront significant resource constraints and considerable uncertainty about the viability of a product, the use hypotheses
    - a hypothesis-driven approach
      + maximizes per unit resources expended, the amout of information gained for resolving such uncertainty
      + an entrepreneur translates her vision into falsifiable business model hypotheses, and thenm tests those hypotheses using a series of minimum viable products

*** steps in hypothesis driven entrepreneurship (7)
    1. develop a vision
       - he must have a vision for the problem that will be addressed
       - aka ideation
    2. translate vision into hypotheses
       - translates vision into falsifiable business model hypothesis
    3. specify MVP tests
       - paul grahan: best way to accelerate learning is to "launch early and often"
       - uncertainty can be resolved to some extent through traditional market research techniques, but feedback is more reliabhle in the hands of real customers in a real-world context
       - launching early and often is done through MVPs
       - E.Ries (Build-measure-learn) 3 lean startup principles
       - by launching series of MVPs, an entrepreneur reduces product development batch sizes andcybe times, yielding two benefits: (a) short product development cycles [accelerates feedback gathering] (b) releasing feature revisions in small batches makes it easier to interpret test results and to diagnose problems
    4. Prioritize tests
       - decide how to sequence the testing of the MVP
       - should give priority to tests that can eliminate considereable risk at low cost
    5. Learn from mvp tests
       - evaluate feedback gained from MVP tests
       - humans are susceptible to cognitive biases
    6. persevere, pivot, or perish
       - after evaluating MVP test results and other marker feedback, decide whether to persevere, pivot, or perish
    7. Scaling and ongoing optimization
       - when product market fit is achieved, ventual can deliver adequate value
       - it is the time to scale, to invest aggressively in customer acquisition and to amass the additional resources required

*** Eric Ries
    - author o fthe lean startup and the startup way
    - MVPs may constrain product functionality and/or operational capabilty
    - constrained functionality
*** False negative
    - indicates that a hypothesis has been disconfirmed when in reality it is valid
*** cognitive bias
    - systematic errors in the individual's reason about the world due to a subjective perception of reality
*** storyboarding
    - is a graphic organizer that provides the viewer with a highlevel view of a project. turns ideas into a logical and convincing sequence
    - allows to easily and inexpensively test multiple product visions, customer journey maps, and UX product flows
    - how to get started
      + what problem are my tearget users currently experiencing
      + what would help alleviate this problem
      + how will my product provide this form of problem alleviation
      + what does a "happy user" look like
